Developed a responsive, client-side budget tracking application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and Tailwind CSS to help users manage their personal finances.

Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for transactions, with data persisted in the browser using localStorage.

Created an interactive dashboard that calculates and displays key metrics like monthly expenses, highest expense, and top spending categories.

Integrated the Chart.js library to provide a dynamic pie chart that visually breaks down expenses by category, offering users immediate financial insights.
